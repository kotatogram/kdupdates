# Kotatogram Desktop update files

This repo provides update files for Kotatogram Desktop autoupdater.

### Currently provided:
* Windows
* Linux (static)
* Linux (AppImage)

After uploading update files, I need to update [feed file](https://github.com/kotatogram/kotatogram.github.io/blob/dev/public/current). But I'm planning to make this process more automatic.

## What I'm planning

Initially I've planned to make stable and beta branch, but I've decided that uploading big files is not effective. So now I'm planning to use Releases for uploading.
